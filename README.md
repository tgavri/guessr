# Guessr - Game Project

## Overview

**Guessr** is an interactive web game platform that challenges players to guess countries based on flags from around the world. Players are shown a flag and asked to choose the correct country from multiple-choice options. The game is designed to be fun and educational, helping players learn about different countries and their flags.

The game includes a simple yet engaging design with a variety of game modes, with the current focus on the **Flags** game mode.

## Features

- **Flag Guessing Game:** Players are shown a flag image and have to select the correct country from four options.
- **Multiple Answer Choices:** The answers are randomized for each question, so the player has to think and guess the correct country.
- **Feedback System:** After each answer, players are given feedback (correct/incorrect) and shown the correct answer if they are wrong.
- **Next Question:** After an answer, players can move on to the next question to keep playing.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Markup for the structure of the game pages.
- **CSS:** Styling for the game, including layout, buttons, and images.
- **JavaScript:** Game logic, including loading flags, randomizing answers, and managing game flow.
